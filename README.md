# BIDEN_AI

Overview
AI-POTUS is a project designed to demonstrate the potential of AI technology in generating coherent and effective responses to questions, using an AI-generated version of President Joe Biden. The project utilizes DistilBERT for generating text responses and TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology for voice synthesis, creating realistic video responses. The end goal is to create a software application or a Telegram bot that generates these responses on demand.

Features
AI-Generated Responses: Utilizes DistilBERT to generate responses to questions.

Voice Synthesis: Produces realistic voice responses using TTS technology.

Video Generation: Creates videos of President Biden delivering the AI-generated responses.

Telegram Bot Integration: Allows users to interact with the AI President Biden through a Telegram bot.
Technologies Used

Language Model: DistilBERT

Voice Synthesis: TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology

Video Generation: Deepfake technology or similar video synthesis tools

Telegram Bot API: For interacting with users via Telegram
